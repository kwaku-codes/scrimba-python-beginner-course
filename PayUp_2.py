# Challenge: Gather Input from Users
# This challenge is to highlight your skill of the input() Python. 

# We need four things from the user:

# - The name of the event or occasion
# - The cost
# - The tip or service charge
# - How many people are splitting the bill

# 1. Replace the hardcoded values for event, cost, service_charge, and group_size with input() prompts.
# 2. Keep grand_total and total_per_person hardcoded for now. They won't be entered by the user.
# 3. Run the program and make sure your prompts are clear and the display looks right.

# input("Service charge? ") 
# input("Was there a tip or a service charge? Enter a whole number (e.g. 20 for 20%: ")


event = "dinner at Fantastic Pizza"
cost = 300
service_charge = 30
group_size = 3
grand_total = 330
total_per_person = 110

print("Welcome to PayUp!")
print() 
print(f"Here's the breakdown for {event}:")
print()
print(f"Cost: ${cost}")
print(f"Service charges: ${service_charge}")
print(f"Group size: {group_size}")
print(f"Grand total: ${grand_total}")
print()
print(f"Each person must PayUp: ${total_per_person}")
